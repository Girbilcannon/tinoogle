# Improvements
1. I've moved all of the CSS into a single external file. Keeping CSS separate should keep things simpler
2. I've gotten rid of a _lot_ of extra CSS that was probably generated by the WYSIWYG editor.
3. I've recolored a few select elements to use TINY-ish colors
4. I've converted a lot of the CSS units to REM instead of PX. REM is more modern and is recommended for most responsive sites, as it's not absolute.
5. The "Cool Facts" button currently links to tinyarmy.org.

#Future
The site as it is now contains no JS, and is thus completely non-interactive.
